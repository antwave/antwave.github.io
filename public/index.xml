      <description>This blog was created by Ant with wholehearted love using Hugo to scratch the longtime itch of documenting whatever is on my mind since my memory is terribly unreliable. I often struggle to vaguely remember past experiences, let alone intrincate thoughts and feelings, which are vollatile and vanish as soon as the wind changes. And what&amp;rsquo;s there more important than thoughts and feelings anyway.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s not the actual itch, however. The real motivation behind this blog is to speak to the world.</description>
