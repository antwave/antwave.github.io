This blog was created by Ant with wholehearted love using Hugo to scratch the longtime itch of documenting whatever is on my mind since my memory is terribly unreliable. I often struggle to vaguely remember past experiences, let alone intrincate thoughts and feelings, which are vollatile and vanish as soon as the wind changes. And what's there more important than thoughts and feelings anyway.

That's not the actual itch, however. The real motivation behind this blog is to speak to the world. And by world I mean the maybe 2 people who will hopefully read some lines on this site. I always feel like I have so much going on inside, as we humans do, and that I so desperately need to let it out. Just typing these words makes me feel heard and understood. So if you are one of the two people who will read this, thank you. Sincerely.
